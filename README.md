# SecureFlow-Vault

I built this project to practice data privacy and encryption techniques. It’s a simple pipeline that cleans sensitive data before locking it down with encryption.

### What it does:
* **Scrubbing:** It uses Regular Expressions (Regex) to find emails in a text file and replaces them with `[REDACTED]`.
* **Encryption:** It uses the `cryptography` library (AES-128) to encrypt the cleaned file so it can't be read without a key.



### Project Structure:
* `vault.py`: The main script that handles the logic.
* `requirements.txt`: List of libraries needed (cryptography).
* `secret.key`: Generated by the script to lock/unlock data.

### How to use it:
1. Install requirements: `pip install cryptography`
2. Run the script: `python vault.py`
3. Check `locked_report.dat` for the encrypted output.

*Note: Developed as part of my Security and Compliance (SCC) studies to understand data-in-transit protection.*
